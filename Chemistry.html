    <h1> <b>Chemistry</b></h1>
    
    <b> What topics I'm enjoying</b>: <br><p>I'm not gonna lie, since the start of the year, I have had a love-hate relationship with Chemistry. Usually what happens is that I do well in a test, begin feeling confident, and before you know it, I have lost my confidence to a modular test. While I have a particular distain towards organics, I find mass spectrometers and infrared spectroscopes very interesting. I would like to believe that Chemistry is the hardest A-level, but I guess that's no excuse.</p><p>While the work may bore me, I have come to realise the importance of Chemistry, expecially when considering degrees in university. I guess the high workload shows that you can handle it without cracking (as if GCSEs weren't enough ;C).</p>
